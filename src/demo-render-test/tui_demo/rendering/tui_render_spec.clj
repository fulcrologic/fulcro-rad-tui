  "Full-stack headless rendering tests for the TUI RAD plugin: a real client app (statechart
   routing + RAD reports/forms + the fulcro-tui rendering plugin) wired to the demo's Pathom
   parser through an in-process loopback remote (no HTTP), backed by a freshly-seeded in-memory
   Datomic Local database. Drives the app with a `string-terminal` and asserts on the painted
   screen — exercising report formatters, sortable headers, enum/boolean fields, and ref pickers
   exactly as a user would see them. JVM-only (Datomic Local does not run under babashka).

   Loads/routes are asynchronous (the statechart event loop + remote), so the helpers POLL the
   rendered screen until the expected content appears rather than sleeping a fixed time — important
   because the suite runs with throwing guardrails (`:all` mode), which slows everything down."
